Axontic is a general bot that supports you and your server well. Easy to use and extremely simple in design.

## ðŸ§¾| Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the Python requirements.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## âœ¨ | Usage

Add your bot token in the config.json.
```json
"token": "INSERT YOUR TOKEN HERE"
```
You can also change your prefix for the bot there.
```json
"prefix": "-"
```
You can also personalize the status.
```python
await client.change_presence(activity=discord.Game(name='with the enemies!'), status=discord.Status.do_not_disturb)
```
At Name you can enter what you will see later in the status. Status shows how the bot is displayed. (Online, Idle, Do Not Disturb)
